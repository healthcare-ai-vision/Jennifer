1. LEARNING BRAIN - a longitudinal dataset on neural plasticity dynamics in Braille and music training

- Type of imaging data : Longitudinal collection of resting-state **fMRI** , task-based fMRI, and anatomical T1-weighted images 
- Number of images : The data was acquired from **60** healthy individuals across **six to seven measurement sessions** (time-points)
- Available classes or labels :
  > Participants are divided into three classes: Braille (tactile) training, Music (piano) training, and a Control group
  > Labels are provided for several functional tasks, including n-back, Stroop, finger tapping, lexical decision, six-dot detection, play music, and passive music listening
  > Data is categorized by time-points (e.g., one week before training, at onset, and various weeks during/after training)
  
- Dataset imbalance : 
- 
- Any challenges you observe (noise, annotation quality, etc.)
